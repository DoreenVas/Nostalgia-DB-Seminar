# Nostalgia-DB-seminar
The following project is a music app designed to help you find songs based on different parameters you enter. So if you’re feeling nostalgic but don’t remember the name of the song we are here to help you!
The application uses the “million song dataset”. It extracts the data, then writes it into CSV files and those files are entered into the database using MySQL workbench.
The java code and SQL are connected through MySQLConnector and JDBC.
For further information please read the “Software documentation” and “User Manual”.
In the “User Manual” you can observe the visuality of each window in the app and receive information about the functionality of it.
The “Software documentation” contains information about the schemes used in the database, the queries used to extract information, the different classes and files and the code structure in general.
